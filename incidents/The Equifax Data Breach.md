# The Equifax Data Breach
## Background
- In September 2017, Equifax, one of the three major credit reporting agencies in the U.S., announced that sensitive personal data of approximately 148 million Americans (as well as some UK and Canadian residents) had been compromised.
- Exposed data included names, Social Security numbers, dates of birth, addresses, driver’s license numbers, and approximately 209,000 credit card numbers.
- Hackers exploited a vulnerability in the Apache Struts framework (CVE-2017-5638) to access Equifax’s online dispute portal without authorization.
## Impact
- Scope of the breach: ~148 million Americans, 15.2 million UK citizens, and ~19,000 Canadians affected.
- Hacker activity: Hackers were active in Equifax’s systems for 76 days, performing over 9,000 data scans and exfiltrating information in batches to avoid detection.
- Data compromised: Names, Social Security numbers, birth dates, addresses, driver’s license numbers, and ~209,000 credit card numbers.
## Response and Criticism
- Delayed disclosure: Equifax did not publicly announce the breach until September, delaying consumers’ ability to respond.
- Website issues: Equifax created a separate site for consumers to check if they were affected, but the site had security flaws and could be exploited by phishing attacks.
- Leadership changes: Following the breach, the CEO, CIO, and CSO resigned.
## Legal Consequences
- Criminal charges: In February 2020, the U.S. government charged four Chinese military hackers with involvement in the Equifax breach.
- Class-action settlements: Equifax agreed to pay at least $380.5 million to settle lawsuits from affected consumers.
- Federal and state penalties: Equifax paid $150 million to the FTC and $175 million to 50 U.S. states and territories.
## Lessons and Recommendations
1. Timely updates and patching: Companies must have strict vulnerability management policies to ensure all systems are updated promptly.
2. Strengthen internal audits and asset management: Regular security audits ensure all assets are accounted for and critical systems are protected first.
3. Transparent crisis communication: Organizations must promptly notify affected individuals and provide effective remediation measures.
4. Legal and regulatory compliance: Companies should comply with all relevant laws and cooperate with regulatory investigations.
