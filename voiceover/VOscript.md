# *Major Cybersecurity Incidents* VO Script

## Introduction
Hello everyone! We are Judy, Jammie, Timur and Saad, and welcome to groups 2's presentation on Major Cybersecurity Incidents! Whoop whoop!

*[With a flair of drama for interest]* I will be your host for today and we will be taking you through our findings on two major incidents related to breaches in cybersecurity: the WannaCry ransomware attack, and the Equifax data breach incident. We will be focusing on what happened, how they spread, their impact, and what was done about it.

## WannaCry
First, we have the WannaCry incident. WannaCry was a ransomware attack launched in May 2017. It encrypted files on infected computers and made them inaccessible. File extensions were changed, and this is the ransom note that would appear if someone tried to open an encrypted file. ***[INSERT PICTURE OF RED RANSOM NOTE]*** They would demand Bitcoin payment worth somewhere between $300-600 to decrypt their files.

WannaCry spread rapidly across networks without any user interaction. It used a Windows exploit called EternalBlue, developed by the US National Security Agency, which was later leaked by a hacker group named Shadow Brokers. This software allowed hackers to target a flaw in the Server Message Block protocol in Windows. Once a computer was infected, it scanned nearby systems on the same network, or over the internet and infected those automatically.

This attack caused global disruption within hours. Over 230,000 computers in over 150 countries were infected. Major organizations like the UK’s National Health Service, FedEx, Renault, Telefonica, Nissan, and Deutsche Bahn were also affected. In the end, it cost an estimation of hundreds of millions to billions of dollars in lost productivity and recovery.

So how was this resolved? A cybersecurity researcher who went by the name MalwareTech unintentionally triggered a built-in “kill switch” of the malware by registering an unregistered domain that WannaCry was connected to at the time. This halted the initial WannaCry outbreak almost immediately. Microsoft also released emergency security patches, which patched the EternalBlue vulnerability, and decryption tools like WannaKey and WannaKiwi that were later created. So all was well – except for the billions of dollars lost...

## Equifax
Moving on! Next, we have the Equifax data breach.

## Final remarks
Now, to end this presentation, I would like to leave you with something I myself wondered when learning about these incidents:
> If you’ve noticed, both incidents took place around the same time (that is, 2017). Don’t you think that’s interesting? Why do you think that might be? Maybe some sort of socio-political circumstances at the time might have come into play? Or was it just a coincidence? Just some food for thought. ^_^

Thank you for your attention and we hope you learned something new after this.
