# Introduction
Hello everyone! We are Judy, Jammie, Timur and Saad, and welcome to groups 2's presentation on Major Cybersecurity Incidents! [insert fanfare]

I will be your host for today and we will be taking you through our findings on two major incidents related to breaches in cybersecurity: 
the WannaCry ransomware attack, and the Equifax data breach incident. We will be focusing on what happened, how they spread, 
their impact, and what was done about it.

# WannaCry


# Equifax


# Final remarks
Now, to end this presentation, I would like to leave you with something I myself wondered when learning about these incidents:
> If you’ve noticed, both incidents took place around the same time (that is, 2017).
> Don’t you think that’s interesting? Why do you think that might be? Maybe some sort of socio-political circumstance at the time might have come into play?
> What made the world so… susceptible to cyber attacks at that time?
