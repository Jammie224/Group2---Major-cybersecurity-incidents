# *Major Cybersecurity Incidents* VO Script (3:10 min)

## Introduction
Hello everyone! We are group 2 and welcome to our presentation on Major Cybersecurity Incidents!

I will be your host for today and we will be taking you through our findings on two major incidents related to breaches in cybersecurity.

## WannaCry
First, we have the WannaCry incident. In May 2017, the WannaCry ransomware attack spread globally. It encrypted files, changed their extensions, and made them inaccessible. This was the ransom note that would appear if someone opened one of the encrypted files, demanding Bitcoin payment worth somewhere between $300-600 to decrypt their files. ***[INSERT PICTURE OF RED RANSOM NOTE]*** 

WannaCry spread rapidly without any user interaction using a Windows exploit called EternalBlue. Once a computer was infected, it automatically scanned for other vulnerable systems on the network and infected those.

Within hours, over 230,000 computers in over 150 countries were infected. Major organizations like the UK’s National Health Service, FedEx, Renault, Telefonica, Nissan, and Deutsche Bahn also fell victim, causing an estimated hundreds of millions to billions of dollars in damages.

So how did it stop? A cybersecurity researcher by the name MalwareTech accidentally triggered a built-in “kill switch” of the malware by registering an unregistered domain that WannaCry was connected to. Microsoft released emergency security patches, and decryption tools like WannaKey and WannaKiwi were later created. So all was well – except for the billions of dollars lost...

## Equifax
Moving on! Next, we have the Equifax data breach. In September 2017, Equifax, a major credit reporting agency in the U.S., announced that sensitive personal data ***[INCLUDE SPECIFIC EXAMPLES ON SCREEN: names, social security numbers, birth dates, addresses, driver’s license numbers, and credit card numbers]*** of approximately 163.2 million Americans, Canadians, and UK citizens had been compromised.

Hackers exploited a vulnerability in the Apache Struts framework to access the agency’s system. The hackers were active in the system for 76 days, performing over 9,000 data scans and exfiltrating information in batches to avoid detection.

In February 2020, four were charged with involvement in the breach, and these hackers were members of the Chinese armed forces. Other legal consequences included class-action settlements, and federal and state penalties.

How Equifax handled this situation was criticized because, first of all, they delayed announcing the breach by 2 months, and then they created a site for consumers to check if they were affected – which sounds promising – but the site itself had security flaws. So following this incident, the CEO, CIO, and CSO of the agency resigned.

## Final remarks
Now, to end this presentation, I would like to leave you with something I myself wondered when learning about these incidents:
> If you’ve noticed, both incidents occurred around the same time (that is, 2017). Don’t you think that’s interesting? Why do you think that might have been? Maybe some sort of socio-political circumstances at the time might have come into play? Or was it just mere coincidence?

Thank you for your attention and we hope you learned something new after this.
