## Topic summary
Our project examines major cybersecurity incidents—how they worked, how they spread, the damage they caused, and how they were contained. It highlights the 2017 Equifax breach, where an Apache Struts flaw enabled months-long access and exposed personal data (names, Social Security numbers, birth dates, addresses, driver’s licenses, and some credit cards), and the WannaCry ransomware worm, which exploited EternalBlue to race across networks and disrupt critical services worldwide. The key insights are well-defined : patch and track assets quickly, segment networks and monitor continuously, maintain reliable backups and practice restores, and communicate incidents openly and promptly.

## Final Question
If you’ve noticed, both incidents occurred around the same time (that is, 2017). Don’t you think that’s interesting? Why do you think that might have been? Maybe some sort of socio-political circumstances at the time might have come into play? Or was it just mere coincidence?
